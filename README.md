# Design Requirements: EEE3097S

**Background:** Some academics in the department of electrical
engineering work in the larger RDI consortium called [SCALE](http://scale.org.za/). In one of
the projects where we are involved, we are building a generic [flexible
buoy that could be installed on the pancake ice in Southern Ocean to
gather environmental data](https://www.news.uct.ac.za/article/-2019-07-15-polar-cyclones-antarctic-sea-ice-and-a-cruise-to-understand-it-all) . You can read more about this buoy, which
we have named as SHARC buoy (!) in [Jamieâ€™s MSc dissertation](https://open.uct.ac.za/bitstream/handle/11427/35788/thesis_ebe_2021_jacobson%20jamie%20nicholas.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). 
His dissertation is also a good example of how to approach a design
problem.
One of the crucial sensors in our buoy is the IMU. It gives information
about the ice as well as wave dynamics. Ideally, we would like as
much of the IMU data as possible. But, transmitting the data using
Iridium is extremely costly. So, we want to compress the IMU data. We
also want to encrypt the data.

**Problem Statement:**
Design an ARM based digital IP using the Raspberry-Pi to encrypt and compress the IMU data. Further requirements are given below. These can be used to derive the exact
specifications for your design.

> Req1. The IMU to be used is [ICM-20649](https://product.tdk.com/system/files/dam/doc/product/sensor/mortion-inertial/imu/data_sheet/ds-000192-icm-20649-v1.0.pdf).
However, we shall not provide you these IMUs. We shall provide a
different IMU. So, you shall need to find out ways to design your
IP without the exact hardware! Here is a link to the device we will
give you: [Waveshare Sense Hat (B)](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Sense_HAT_(B))

> Req2. Oceanographers have indicated that they would like to be
able to extract at least 25% of the Fourier coefficients of the
data. Make sure that your compression satisfies this.

> Req3. In addition to reducing the amount of data we also want to
reduce the amount of processing done in the processor (as it
takes up power which is limited). Try to minimize the
computation required for your IP.

**Suggested Methodology:** This is a task with a few limitations. The biggest
of which might be the lack of the actual sensor! Here is a suggested
methodology.

1) **Requirement Analysis or Paper Design:** The first step is to
understand the requirements and convert them into hard
specifications. Then you must divide your IP into sub-systems and
specify the inter and intra sub-system interactions. Lastly, you
should work on detailed acceptance test procedures, i.e. how
would you demonstrate that your design satisfies all the
specifications.

2) **Implementation and Demonstration using Data from Computer:**
In checking the functionality of your codes, you can set-up tests
by sending data from your computer. These set of validations
can be your next deliverable.

3) **Implementation and Demonstration using Data from an Onboard Sensor:** Lastly, you need to show that the Pi can process
data from an on-board sensor. Choose any sensors you think to
be pertinent and use them to validate that your algorithms work.
